PHOENIX EMULATOR TRANSLATION PROJECT TO ENGLISH BETA 0.1
========================================================

I made this translation patch in order to ease the use 
of the best 3DO console emulator in existence and it is
also a great multiemulator with very high compatibility:

Panasonic/Goldstar 3DO  100%
Atari Jaguar            95%
ColecoVision            98%
Master System/Game Gear 99%

Unfortunately the emulator is quite unknown due to the 
fact of being completely written in Russian, until the 
creation of this modification that translates from 
Russian to Spanish or English languages according to 
your personal preferences.

COMPATIBILITY OF THIS PATCH
===========================

The patch supports:

1.- Windows x86/x64
2.- Linux x86/x64
3.- Android (not verified but it should work)

BUGS FEATURES AND KNOWN LIMITATIONS
===================================

The patch translates into English/Spanish languages:

98% of the texts and 99% of menus and options.

What is missing then?

Acknowledgments/credits (Does not affect the usage).

Optional text of the paid version for Android in Google 
Play Store, although the original link does not exists
anymore so it is useless (Does not affect the usage).

Some of the texts when customizing controls, but
functional texts like "down" "up" etc are translated
(Practically does not affect the usage.)


HOW TO USE THIS TRANSLATION
===========================

1.- Download the emulator from this page for your system:

    http://www.arts-union.ru/node/23

2.- Just go to the desired language folder:

    ".\spanish" (for Spanish language file)
    ".\english" (for English language file)

3.- Copy the file "translation.xml" to the main folder of
    the emulator and overwrite the existing one.
	
4.- Done.
